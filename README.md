## Personal Portfolio Project

A project to demonstrate the usage of CSS & HTML elements to create a personal portfolio of past work that can be sent to an employer. I took many creative liberties on this, so it deviates from the example given pretty heavily.

# Motivation

I always wanted to create a personal portfolio for myself, but I didn't possess the knowledge to do so until recently. As such, this page will be updated over time.

## Installation

This program should run within any native browser environment. Simply input the URL into your search bar, and it will load the webpage.

## Usage

There are a few links enclosed within the portfolio, mostly to my social media channels it should be noted that the "Contact Me" bar currently is non-functional.
